# Hackathon Management System

This is a (manual) fork of the open-source project [Hackathon Management System](https://github.com/knoffhoff/hms)

Because private forks of pulic repos are not possible here is the flow to update the project ([taken from this source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private)):

1. `git remote add public https://github.com/knoffhoff/hms.git`
2. `git pull public main`
3. `git push origin main`
