# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

For local development, you should set the `.env` file variables to:

```
REACT_APP_CORE_URL=http://localhost:3000/local
PORT=3001
REACT_APP_AZURE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

After `npm install`, and `npm start`, you should be able to see the frontend on `http://localhost:3001`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
